# Motif Finding Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of three classic motif-finding algorithms in bioinformatics:

- **Greedy Motif Search**
- **Randomized Motif Search**
- **Randomized Motif Search with Gibbs Sampling**

These algorithms aim to identify shared motifs (subsequences) in a given set of DNA sequences.

## üß¨ What is a Motif?

In bioinformatics, a motif is a short, recurring sequence pattern with a likely biological function, such as DNA regulatory elements like promoters or enhancers.

Because motifs can vary slightly and are hidden within noisy data, specialized algorithms are used to detect them across multiple sequences, helping reveal important signals in the genome.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prepare Input

Ensure your DNA sequences are listed line-by-line in a plain text file (e.g., `dna_list_example.txt`). Each line should contain a reference ID (e.g. seq1) followed by a single DNA string. For example:

  seq1
  ACATCGATCATGCTGACTGA

  seq2
  ACAGCTTTTACGGAGCGTTA

### 2. Run the Algorithms

Each script reads from the input file and prints:

- The **consensus motif**
- The **score** (lower score = better consensus)
- The list of **best motifs** found

---

#### Greedy Motif Search

  bash
```python greedy_motif_search_with_pseudocounts.py```

#### Randomized Motif Search

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search.py```

#### Gibbs Sampler Motif Search 

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search_with_gibbs_sampler.py```

You can change the default parameters k (k-mer length), t (list size), and N (runs) directly in each script's function call at the bottom.

## üß† Algorithm Overviews

### Greedy Motif Search

- Iteratively builds a motif set by choosing the most probable k-mer using a profile.
- Fast and deterministic, but may get stuck in local optima.
- Time complexity: O(t * n^2 * k)

### Randomized Motif Search

- Starts with random k-mers, updates motifs using profiles until convergence.
- Repeated multiple times to improve chances of a better result.
- Time complexity: O(N * I * t * n * k)

### Gibbs Sampling

- Iteratively refines motifs by randomly sampling one at a time based on profiles.
- Often yields better motifs with enough iterations.
- Time complexity: O(N * k * (n + t))
